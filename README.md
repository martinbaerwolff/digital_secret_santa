# Digital scret santa

Python GUI implementation of the digital and remote variant of the game "secret santa" in the times of Covid. Pictures of the presentees and the gifts (wrapped and unwrapped) are necessary. The pictures must be in the corresponding folders "people", "gifts" and "wraps" and in equal numbers. Each player must have been given a gift in advance. The game works best if the images of both the wrapped and unwrapped gifts are marked with the name of the person to whom they were initially drawn.

Have fun playing the game and Merry Christmas!
